## Introduction

Have you wondered about the power of bicycles to fight climate change? 
 Last spring when a friend of mine at Smith told me that she wanted a car so she could have more independence, I immediately screamed inside myself thinking in the tons of carbon dioxide that that car would deliver to the environment in its lifespan.  I told her that she should wait to have a lot of money and buy an electric car instead or get a bicycle in the meantime. She laughed and seemed to agree. Our decisions today have a long and imperceptible effect especially when we talk about global warming and climate change.

 According to [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/) there are several gases in the atmosphere trapping heat. One of those gases is carbon dioxide (CO2). This gas is released into the atmosphere through various natural processes and mostly, activities caused only by humans.  Deforestation and burning of fossil fuels are the primary drivers of carbon emissions. We have increased the levels of CO2 by 47% since the industrial revolution.

 Last year, in October, [Smith College divested from fossil fuels](https://www.smith.edu/president-kathleen-mccartney/letters/2019-20/fossil-fuels-and-smith-endowment). The college voted to exclude Smith College’s endowment from any future investment with such industry. . This was a major victory for students who pressured for such change and for the community in general. It is a step we are convinced other colleges and universities will follow as well.

Last year we also got acquainted with the eloquence and determination of a 17 year old Swiss red hair girl. I remember her clearly for her bold statement: “How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words” ![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok) Greta Thunberg, an student and environmental activist, became the youngest and most outspoken critic of the lack of global policies to fight climate change. Perhaps the most heroic act we might remember about Ms. Thunberg is her decision to sail instead of flying from Europe to the United States to attend the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit. 

What does all of that has to do with the citylike system in New York City and the data presented in this project? 
According to a Greenhouse Gas emission report for NYC in 2016, 30% of the city emissions came from the transportation system. Cars are the largest generators of emission with 96% footprint. Cars powered with gasoline composed 80% of the transportation base emissions. See figures 1 and 2. [^1]

##Figure 1.

In this perspective, we could follow the example of the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom  and Germany that have incentivized the use of bicycles and discourage the use of cars by imposing heavy taxes on gasoline. Bikes can be used to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Promoting the use of bicycles is essential to mitigate the effect of climate change and local government must facilitate adequate financial support.

#Our data:

Note : The data that we used was [citibikenyc](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).  Trips made by staff members in their labor activities was removed as well as any trips lower than 60 second as they were false starts.



This article is about arguing whether age and gender are drivers for use the citibike system in New York and weather this could be a rationale tied to climate change perceptions. We also seek to expose the areas of higher confluence in the city for the use of these bikes.

## Exploratory data analysis

```{sql, connection=db, output.var = "Trips_during_school_year"}
SELECT duration, birth_year, gender, start_station_id FROM citibike.trips
WHERE duration > 600
AND user_type = 'subscriber'
AND stop_time < '2017-06-01#' OR start_time > '2017-09-01#';
```


# We want to group those users younger than 30 and older than 30 to know which group uses the bike system more frequently

```{sql connection=db, output.var = "Trips"}
SELECT duration, birth_year, gender
 FROM citibike.trips
WHERE duration > 600
AND user_type = 'subscriber';

```

```{r}
Trips_Age <- Trips %>% 
  mutate(age_category = ifelse(birth_year >= 1987, "Thirthy or Younger", "Older Than Thirty"))
```


## In our first graph we plotted it the total trips people of each age group took in 2017. We found that  older than 30-year old people use the systems more than 30-year old or younger. With people aged 25 and 32 being the group using the bike system more 25 thousand trips a year

```{r}
Trips_Age %>% 
  group_by(birth_year, age_category) %>% 
   summarize(total = sum(n())/10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = birth_year, y = total, fill= age_category)) + 
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "lightblue"))+
  xlim(c(1957, 2005))+
   labs (title = " Use of the Citibike System According to Age in 2017")+
  labs(y= "Total Trips in Tens of Thousands", x= "Birth Year")+
  labs(fill= "Age Category")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "black", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
 
```


### In our second graph we wanted to find out which gender is more likely to use the bike system in New York City. We found that men are more incline than women to ride the public bikes.

```{r}
Trips %>% 
  group_by(birth_year, gender) %>% 
  filter(birth_year >= 1957, gender != 0) %>%
  mutate(gender = ifelse(gender == 1, "Male", "Female")) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(n())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = birth_year, y = total, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_col()+
   scale_fill_manual(values =c("Pink", "lightblue"))+
  labs(title = "Gender Usage of the Bike System in 2017")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "black", hjust = 0.4, face = "bold"))+
  labs(x= "Birth Year", y = "Total duration Trips?")+
    labs(fill = "Gender")
  
```

```{sql connection=db, output.var = "Trips"}
SELECT duration, birth_year, gender
 FROM citibike.trips
WHERE duration > 600

```


# Station Data

```{sql connection=db, output.var = "months_station"}
SELECT station_id, name, num_starts, num_stops, avg_lat, avg_lon
 FROM citibike.station_months 
```

What stations get the most average rides (both starts and stops)?
Average numbers of trips per month:

```{r}
months_station_2 <- months_station %>% 
  #select(-station_id) %>% 
  mutate(trips = num_starts + num_stops) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(total_months = sum(n()),
            total_starts = sum(num_starts), 
          avg_trips = total_starts/total_months,
          avg_lat = first(avg_lat),
          avg_lon = first(avg_lon)
         )
```



# Station Data


```{r}
 Top_50_Stations <- months_station_2 %>%
 head(50) 
station_pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = c("#FF9999", "#FF0000"), 
  domain = Top_50_Stations %>%
    pull(avg_trips) %>%
    range())

leaflet(Top_50_Stations) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(lng = ~avg_lon, lat = ~avg_lat, weight = 3,
    radius = ~sqrt(avg_trips)*3,
    color = ~station_pal(avg_trips), popup = paste("<b>",Top_50_Stations$name, "</b>", "<br>",
                           "Average Number of Bicycles Used:", Top_50_Stations$avg_trips),opacity = 100)
```

# How does weather affect bike trips?

While biking is a great way for individuals to lower their personal carbon emissions, it's not always accessible. Weather conditions can deter potential bike riders, and its challenges range from minor inconveniences (such as light rain) to major risks (such as ice). How do weather conditions affect daily citibike trips -- and, by extension, daily carbon reduction?

```{r}
#loading the data
#This weather data was accessed through NOAA and was collected in Central Park. The numbers may not exactly reflect weather conditions throughout the entire city.
weather_data <- read.csv("weather2017.csv")
```
```{r}
#The reason why we reshaped the data to make it long was because we wanted to use precipitation (total precip -- both rain and snow) as one variable that we could plot against variables such as number of rides, but we also wanted to keep the distinction (so that we could see the difference in rain and snow)
weather_data_long <- weather_data %>%
  mutate("RAIN" = PRCP) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(RAIN, SNOW), names_to = "prcp_type", values_to = "amount")

```

```{sql connection=db, output.var = "all_trips"}
SELECT CAST(start_time AS DATE) AS time
 FROM citibike.trips;
```
```{r}
#Note for SQL chunk (above): to convert the date data type I used resources https://www.essentialsql.com/datatype-conversion-in-sql-using-cast-and-convert/ and https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp
#Converting the datetime format to only date was important for grouping the number of trips by data and for joining the trips data with the weather data (which was daily)

#Since "time" is now date, grouping by time means that we can find the number of trips per day taken in the entire citibike system (subscribers AND one-time customers)
all_trips_grouped <- all_trips %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarize(num_trips = n())
```

```{r}
#Joining the trips and weather data
trips_weather <- weather_data_long %>% 
  full_join(all_trips_grouped, by=c('DATE'='time')) 

trips_weather[is.na(trips_weather)] <- 0
```
## The affect of precipitaion

```{r}
#Type & amount of precipiation against citibike trips
trips_weather %>% 
  filter(amount > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = amount, y = num_trips, color = prcp_type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous("Number of Citibike Trips", labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_continuous("Amount of Precipitation (in)") +
  scale_color_manual("Type", values = c('darkblue', 'deepskyblue'), labels = c("Rain", "Snow")) +
  labs(title = "How Precipitation Affects Daily Citibike Trips", subtitle = "Excluding days without rain or snow")
```
"When it rains, it pours" is not always an accurate statement. The graph above depicts the inches of rain or snow which accumulate *on days when there is precipitation* and its affect on number of Citibike trips. Few days in NYC see more than an inch of precipitation, and mild rain doesn't seem to correlate with a reduction in bike trips. However, there does seem to be a reduction in trips on days with more than 2 inches of precipitation, especially for snow. Although snowfall is relatively rare, heavy snow seems to significantly deter riders from using bikes.

The biggest question left over from this graph is: If low precipitation doesn't correlate with number of trips, why is the range of trips on low-precip. days so varied? The next figure provides an answer.


```{r}
#Temperature analysis (how temp -- and also precip -- affect number of rides)
trips_weather %>% 
  group_by(DATE) %>% 
  mutate(total_prcp = sum(amount),
         Precipitation = case_when(total_prcp >= 2 ~ 'High',  #help with case when from https://www.statology.org/conditional-mutating-r/
                                   total_prcp >= 1 ~ 'Medium',
                                   total_prcp < 1 ~ 'Low'))%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = TMAX, y = num_trips)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = total_prcp) ) +
  geom_smooth(color = "grey1") +
  scale_color_distiller("Precipitation (in)", palette = "Blues", values = c(0.001, 1), na.value = "white", direction = 1) +
  #theme_dark() +
  scale_y_continuous("Number of Citibike Trips", labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_continuous("Daily Max. Temperature (F)") +
  labs(title = "How Temperature & Precipitation Affect Daily Citibike Trips", subtitle = "Days without precipitation colored in white")
```

This graph shows that there is association between daily temperature and number of Citibike trips, with trips increasing as temperature increases until about 80*F, at which point there is a slight decrease. Although days with precipitation generally have fewer riders than dry days at similar temperatures, there is only clear decrease in ridership on days with high precipitation.


## Seasonal Citibike ridership: a worrying trend?

```{r}
#Number of trips over time (ie date), also colored by temp.
trips_weather %>%
  #filter((DATE >= "2017-02-1") & (DATE <= "2017-03-21")) %>% 
  group_by(DATE) %>% 
  mutate(total_prcp = sum(amount),
         Precipitation = case_when(total_prcp >= 2 ~ 'High',
                                   total_prcp >= 1 ~ 'Medium',
                                   total_prcp < 1 ~ 'Low')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = DATE, y = num_trips, color = TMAX)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_distiller("Temperature (F)", palette = "RdYlBu") +
  scale_y_continuous("Number of Citibike Trips", labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_discrete("Date in 2017", breaks = c("2017-01-01", "2017-02-01", "2017-03-01", "2017-04-01", "2017-05-01", "2017-06-01", "2017-07-01", "2017-08-01", "2017-09-01", "2017-10-01", "2017-11-01", "2017-12-01"), labels = c("Jan.", "Feb.", "Mar.", "Apr.", "May", "Jun.", "Jul.", "Aug.", "Sept.", "Oct.", "Nov.", "Dec.")) +
  labs(title = "Daily Citibike Trips Throughout 2017")
```

As earlier demonstrated, there is a strong association between temperature and Citibike ridership. This graph demonstrates that, since temperature in NYC changes drastically between seasons, the number of Citibike trips changes drastically as well. Many fewer daily rides are taken during the winter months than in summer, which could complicate any systemic shift towards bikes as a carbon-neutral transportation.
